    <h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>
    <p>Homemade lasagna may have a few steps, but each step is easy – and I assure you it’s worth the time; the perfect Italian meal!</p>
    <p>The ingredients in this recipe are all things you know and it’s not difficult at all! All you’ll need for this easy lasagna recipe is one pan, one bowl, and a 9×13 baking dish!</p>
    <p>A quick overview of the layers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> <b>Cheese Filling</b> Mix the ricotta and cheeses (per recipe below) with an egg in a bowl, and set aside. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!</li>
        <li> <b>Meat Sauce</b> Brown the onion, garlic, and meat in a pot on the stovetop. Add the pasta sauce and tomato paste & simmer a few minutes.</li>
        <li> <b>Layer Together</b> Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with noodles and bake until bubbling</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Layer Lasagna</h2>
    <p>Once you have prepared the meat sauce and cheeses, you’re ready to layer. This is the order of layers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>sauce – noodles – cheese</li>
        <li>sauce – noodles – cheese</li>
        <li>sauce – noodles – cheese</li>
        <li>noodles – sauce (bake) – cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread about a cup of meat sauce into a 9×13 pan. Add a layer of noodles.</li>
        <li>Top the noodles with some of the cheese mixture.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of noodles and sauce</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake.</li>
        <li>Remove foil, top with mozzarella and parmesan and bake another 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How Long to Bake</h2>
    <p>Baking time lasagna for this recipe is about one hour total. To get that perfect browned cheese topping, you’ll need to bake it in two stages.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Layer, cover it tightly in foil to retain the moisture.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the foil, top with cheese, and return to the oven for another 15 minutes, or until the top is browned and your easy lasagna is bubbling.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Make Ahead</h2>
    <p>Lasagna can be prepared ahead of time and refrigerated up to 2 days before baking. It can also be frozen before or after baking.</p>
    <h2>To Freeze</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is one of the best meals to make ahead and freeze. Double or triple the recipe and freeze some for another day. Defrost in the refrigerator overnight and bake as directed.</p>
    <h2>To Reheat Lasagna</h2>
    <p>If you’ve frozen leftovers, pop them in the oven at 350°F covered, until reheated. This should take about 30 minutes! Of course, leftovers are perfectly heated in the microwave too!</p>
